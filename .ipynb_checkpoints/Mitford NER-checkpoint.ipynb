      "May 2st 1821.Seymour Court near MarlowHow much I thank you, my dear Sir, for your very interesting account of poor John Keats--It explains at once the only want that I ever found in his poetry--a want of heart. Oh he should have lived to have become happier, better, wiser, with his fine perception of beauty he could not have failed to discover what was right--& health & happiness would have done every thingeverything for him--poor John Keats!--Do not you see with what a shaking hand I am writing? I must tell you how it happens. A very kind & partial  old friend, Mr. Johnson, the owner of this beautiful  place is lately dead--& his Sister sent for me to assist her in arranging & cataloguing his very curious & valuable library. Mr. JohnsonMr. Johnson was a great Politician, an active member of the Hampden Club, & all his political books  are left to your Countryman Mr. Northmore. So we are dividing as well as we can the Politics from the History & getting the rest into order for sale--never I believe had mortal such a job since the Princess in the fairy tale who was ordered to separate the plumage of each bird from a room full of feathers.--I have got a room entirely full of books French English Italian & Latin all pell mell--no two in their proper place & nobody to help but a mistresspartly blind & a maid wholly stupid. Oh dear me! to have been lifting about heavy books for these three days, & making something like a catalogue between whiles, & I am now sat down to talk to you to comfort & refresh myself. In addition to the other difficulties of this booksorting, I have the strongest possible desire to crib as much as I can from Mr. Northmore--for Mr. Johnson having  unfortunately neglected to renew the lives this lovely place & the valuable estate round it fall immediately to the Dean & Chapter of Bristol, & the excellent sister who has devoted so many years to his comfort will return to comparative poverty. I hope the library will sell well.--Do you know any thinganything of the scenery round Marlow? Oh it is so beautiful! Especially the view from this house which stands on the brow of a hill & looks down on Marlow (a town made to be looked at a mile off the charm vanishes when you approached nearer)--Marlow so intermixed with trees--& and the Thames winding like a snake--showing himself only by glimpses, but given the perpetual consciousness of his presence--Bisham Abbeythat oldest & most venerable place--& the whole prospect crowned by hanging beech woods just in their young shining leaves  so enchantingly varied by gleams of the sun wandering over them--& the hills folding in so exquisitely! Oh it is beautiful! I wished for you very much last night when I went out to hear the nightingales--for you & Miss James. You will see her I hope for she is in London--So tell me how she looks--for I am afraid she takes no care of herself--she has been very ill.I have such an opinion of your critical talents that I cannot help asking you to take the trouble to read a little dramatic sketch called Emilyin the present number of the Baldwin's MagazineMitford is likely referring to \"Emily, A Dramatic Sketch\", which appeared in the London Magazine 3.17 (May 1821): 499-505.--& to tell me if Mr. Talfourd's kindness misleads him when he says that there is some indication of dramatic talent in the dialogue. I don't ask you to tell me the truth without flattery--because you are truth itself. I have written some more of those little dramas & intend giving a series in the Baldwin's Magazine, Mr. Baldwin having expressed himself pleased with them though I don't believe he knows the name of his new correspondent. By the bye I have not seen the Magazine--but know it is inserted & I feel quite proud at being in such good company--I was quite astonished when I found my sketch was accepted.--Oh my dear Mr. Haydon you have no notion how much Papa laughs at your complimenting my handwriting.--he always says I write worse than any oneanyone in the  world--& very unluckily Mr. Macready to whom Mr. Talfourd> gave my Fiesco could scarcely make it out--there's an affront! My very best specimen of penmanship!--so that I was obliged to have it copied out to be sent to the Manager. I don't know its fate yet--but I dare say it's rejected, & I shall write another.What you say of your picture is delightful to all of us--I have no doubt but you will paint on till Christ's entrance shall be to your future pictures as Macbeth is to that. I am sure you will--quite sure. Oh how proud England will be of her great painter And how worthy of such a painter is our glorious England!My candle is going out--& I must go out too--that is to say I must go in.--I believe the dogs came to us the first week in October--so that the man has had them rather more than half a year--I mention this as you desire it & as the man is not rich. The dogs are quite well--especially the dear Daphne.--Papa & Mama are not at home--or they would send every sort of kind message--I want them very much--but I shall go to them next Tuesday thank God! I long to be back at my own dear home beautiful as this place is, & kind as is its mistress--In the mean timemeantime I must go to bed or I shall be in the dark.Good bye--God bless you--\n",

Oh he should have lived to have become happier, better, wiser, with his fine perception of beauty he could not have failed to discover what was right--&amp; health &amp; happiness would have done <choice><sic>every thing</sic><reg>everything</reg></choice> for him--poor <persName ref=\"#Keats\">John Keats</persName>!--Do not you see with what a shaking hand I am writing? I must tell you how it happens. A very kind &amp; partial <del rend=\"squiggles\"/> old friend, <persName ref=\"#Johnson_Mr\">Mr. Johnson</persName>, the owner of this beautiful  <rs type=\"place\" ref=\"#SeymourCt\">place</rs> is lately dead--&amp; his <persName ref=\"#Johnson_Miss\">Sister</persName> sent for me to assist her in arranging &amp; cataloguing his very curious &amp; valuable library. <persName ref=\"#Johnson_Mr\">Mr. Johnson</persName><persName ref=\"#Johnson_Mr\">Mr. Johnson</persName> was a great Politician, an active member of the <orgName ref=\"#Hampden_Club\">Hampden Club</orgName>, &amp; all his political books <del rend=\"squiggles\"/> are left to your Countryman <persName ref=\"#Northmore_Thos\">Mr. Northmore</persName>. So we are dividing as well as we can the Politics from the History &amp; getting the rest into order for sale--never I believe had mortal such a job since the Princess in the fairy tale who was ordered to separate the plumage of each bird from a room full of feathers.--I have got a room entirely full of books French English Italian &amp; Latin all pell mell--no two in their proper place &amp; nobody to help but a <rs type=\"person\" ref=\"#Johnson_Miss\">mistress</rs><del rend=\"squiggles\"/><add place=\"above\">partly</add> blind &amp; a maid wholly stupid. Oh dear me! to have been lifting about heavy books for these three days, &amp; making something like a catalogue between whiles, &amp; I am now sat down to talk to you to comfort &amp; refresh myself. In addition to the other difficulties of this booksorting, I have the strongest possible desire to <emph rend=\"underline\">crib</emph> as much as I can from <persName ref=\"#Northmore_Thos\">Mr. Northmore</persName>--for <persName ref=\"#Johnson_Mr\">Mr. Johnson</persName> having <pb n=\"2\"/> unfortunately neglected to renew the lives this lovely place &amp; the valuable estate round it fall immediately to the Dean &amp; Chapter of <placeName ref=\"#Bristol\">Bristol</placeName>, &amp; the excellent sister who has devoted so many years to his comfort will return to comparative poverty. I hope the library will sell well.--Do you know <choice><sic>any thing</sic><reg>anything</reg></choice> of the scenery round <placeName ref=\"#Marlow\">Marlow</placeName>? Oh it is so beautiful! Especially the view from this house which stands on the brow of a hill &amp; looks down on <placeName ref=\"#Marlow\">Marlow</placeName> (a town made to be looked at a mile off the charm vanishes when you approached nearer)--<placeName ref=\"#Marlow\">Marlow</placeName> so intermixed with trees--&amp; and the <placeName ref=\"#Thames\">Thames</placeName> winding like a snake--showing himself only by glimpses, but given the perpetual consciousness of his presence--<placeName ref=\"#Bisham_Abbey\">Bisham Abbey</placeName>that oldest &amp; most venerable place--&amp; the whole prospect crowned by hanging beech woods just in their young shining leaves <del rend=\"squiggles\"/> so enchantingly varied by gleams of the sun wandering over them--&amp; the hills folding in so exquisitely! Oh it is beautiful! I wished for you very much last night when I went out to hear the nightingales--for you &amp; <persName ref=\"#James_Miss\">Miss James</persName>.

By the bye I have not seen the <title ref=\"#LondonMag\">Magazine</title>--but<pb n=\"2\"/> know it is inserted &amp; I feel quite proud at being in such good company--I was quite astonished when I found my sketch was accepted.--Oh my dear <persName ref=\"#Haydon\">Mr. Haydon</persName> you have no notion how much <persName ref=\"#Mitford_Geo\">Papa</persName> laughs at your complimenting my handwriting.--he always says I write worse than <choice><sic>any one</sic><reg>anyone</reg></choice> in the  world--&amp; very unluckily <persName ref=\"#Macready_Wm\">Mr. Macready</persName> to whom <persName ref=\"#Talfourd_Thos\">Mr. Talfourd&gt;</persName> gave my <title ref=\"#Fiesco_MRMplay\">Fiesco</title> could scarcely make it out--there's an affront!
